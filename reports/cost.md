# What it cost

Six numbers per facet, each a median over the cases in that facet at the headline level, and each a ratio against the reference compiler building the same program on the same machine in the same run. A ratio below one is the compiler under test doing better.

| number | what it is | why it is separate |
|---|---|---|
| code | Allocated executable sections in the image | This is the code quality number. It is what the optimizer decided and nothing else. |
| on disk | The whole executable file | What a build costs somebody. Includes the runtime, the symbol table and whatever the linker padded with, none of which the optimizer chose. |
| data | Allocated initialized sections in the image | A compiler that unrolls by materializing a table and one that folds the loop away move the code column the same way and this column the opposite way. |
| compile | Wall clock for the build | Noisy and machine dependent. Worth watching between two commits of the compiler, not worth quoting on its own. |
| run | Wall clock for the program, fastest of the repetitions | The fastest rather than the mean, because every slower measurement has somebody else's work in it and there is no way to subtract that. |
| memory | Largest high water mark in the compiler's process tree | Sampled from outside the process, so it is a floor rather than an exact peak, and it is missing entirely on any platform that is not Linux. |

None of these are averaged into a single figure for the corpus. A mean over fifty facets of wildly different shapes is a number with no referent.

This run had no compiler under test in it. Every column above is a ratio of one compiler against the reference, and the only compiler here was the reference, so there is nothing to put in them. That is what a run on a machine rucc has no back end for looks like, and it is still worth doing, because it checks 1461 expected answers against a compiler that has been wrong about very few things since 1987.
